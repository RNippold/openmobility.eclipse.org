- Where should we proceed with openMobility?
- Two options for the nature of openMobility:
  a) openMobility is a place to build and start a community around the topics mobility (zero Budget, almost no infrastructure, no program plan, ...)
  b) openMobility should be a place to specifically work towards a common goal (with a program plan, a dedicated budget, ...)
